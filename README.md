# Flexbox Demo

**This project serves as a tool for teaching CSS Flexbox:** Do the katas together with learners, narrating as you go. Please see the solutions for direction.

### Advice:
-  Repetition is good.
-  Focus on the vocabulary of "main axis" and "cross axis".
-  Continually reinforce the idea that flexbox is as much about distributing available *space* as it is about distributing flex *items*.

#### TODO:
- Detect plaintext-only feature and prompt with undo? Or other attempt at cross-browser compat with Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Cache <style> elements individually
- Then add a "View Solution" toggle for each `.container`
- Capture Ctrl+/ and Cmd+/ to toggle line comments
- Perhaps the "Solutions" may be cachable, as well, to be restored by a page-wide Reset
