# Flexbox Demo, Katas, and Reference

This project is meant to be used in three ways:

1. **As a set of katas:** Fork and clone it. Open `index.html` in a browser. Then edit `stylesheets/flex-containers.css`. You will find that, for example, ".container-2 {}" is where you will write the CSS for what you see in the browser as "2 â€“ Basic Flex". Work through these like katas.

2. **As tool for demoing Flexbox to others:** Do the katas together with students, narrating as you go. To prepare, please see `stylesheets/solutions.css` for the solution code.

3. **As a basic reference for basic Flexbox features:** When this project is hosted on GitHub Pages, the JavaScript in `scripts/onload.js` detects this automatically *and switches the active stylesheet* from `stylesheets/flex-containers.css` to `stylesheets/solutions.css`, so that each container correctly displays the effect of the Flexbox feature being discussed.

#### TODO:
- **Show the CSS:** Use a syntax highlighting library and show on the page the implemented CSS for each container, so that we don't have to flip back and forth between the page rendered in the browser and the CSS file.
- **Edit the CSS live:** Permit live-editing of the CSS for each container, to make the page interactive.
